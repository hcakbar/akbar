                Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of
                English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a
                convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg
                typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and
                philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately
                render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem
                ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't
                contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic
                the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

                In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be
                made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled
                with content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible
                content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the
                text, disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous
                or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have
                been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.

                Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32â€“3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the
                Boundaries of Goods and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro quisquam est qui
                dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known version ("Neither is
                there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it"). It was found by
                Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he
                searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in
                that literary corpus.
